## About Me

I am a sophomore CSE student studying at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. I am interested in Machine Learning and have completed multiple projects in it. I primarily work with Computer Vision Based models and have been part of a research internship. I also read research papers on the field frequently and have implemented some of the common Machine Learning architectures from scratch after reading the papers. Most of the work I do is on PyTorch and have hosted some of my work in HuggingFace. Other than Machine Learning, I also know frameworks like Django and Flutter and have built many projects using these frameworks.

Some of my recent projects on ML include making UNET and ResNet34 model from scratch and hosting them on HuggingFace after training on water-body segmentation and bird-classification datasets respectively. You can find them [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gauthamk/water-body-segmentation) and [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gauthamk/pytorch-resnet34-bird-classification).

I have also worked on other projects such as [JUNO-Editor](https://github.com/gauthamk02/JUNOEditor), an open source desktop app built as part of the NASA SpaceApps Challenge for processing and editing the raw multichannel grey-scale images captured by JUNO Spacecraft and combining to make a RGB photo with additional functionalities for image processing and auto-enhancement, and [PocketTracker](https://github.com/gauthamk02/pocket_tracker), a mobile app for expense tracking that can automatically parse the details from the bill photo and update the database.

Moreover, working with these diverse projects has helped me get a good understanding of the software development process and I have developed the skill for learning new things quickly and impelmenting them.

I also participate routinely in hackathons, workshops and other technical events and I am an active member of the student-run open-source club [amfoss.in](https://amfoss.in/) and routinely contribute to open-source projects.
